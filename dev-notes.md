# Dev Notes — NHL Web Scraper

## Weekend Plan (June 1–2)

- [x] Review existing `userMenu.py` and `nhlScraper.py`
- [x] Add `headless` mode to Selenium
- [x] Clean up XPath selectors for stability
- [x] Create initial README.md with overview and instructions

---

## Weekly Plan (June 1–5)

### 🧱 Backend Prep

- [x] Refactor scraper into functions (goals, assists, points)
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment
- [x] Install and configure Flask
- [x] Create base Flask route to test connection
- [x] Build first API route: `/stats/goals`

## Weekly Plan (June 22-28)

- [x] Create routes for goalies
- [x] Create function to select game type (Regular Season / Playoffs)

---

### ⚛️ Frontend (Coming Soon)

- [ ] Scaffold new React app
- [ ] Create simple homepage with stat selection
- [ ] Connect to Flask backend via fetch
- [ ] Display JSON results in a table

---

## 📝 Notes to Self

- Keep frontend and backend loosely coupled
- Selenium can be slow — consider caching results later
- Use `print()` or logging to test API endpoints before integrating with React
- Keep `PATH` to ChromeDriver portable for easier deployment

## Color Palette

## 🐛 Issues to Watch

- NHL site layout may change and break XPath
- Long scraping time could cause API timeout
- Clicking elements may fail if not visible — use `WebDriverWait`

---

## 💡 Ideas for Later

- Add dropdown for selecting team or player stats
- Allow user to export results to `.csv`
- Allow users to select type(By Season, All-time), Season, Game Type(Playoffs)
